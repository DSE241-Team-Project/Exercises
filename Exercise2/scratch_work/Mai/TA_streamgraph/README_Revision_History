- Corrected the years, now the data starts from 1924
- Ideally, the axis should display from 1924 and have increments of every 4 years.  Unfortunately, after many tries, it can't be done at the moment.  It displays every 10 years.

Improvement needs: 
- xAxis is started from 1990, therefore the data before it does not get display.
Need to change the Axis d3.time.scale() but hasn't gotten successful yet.
